I'm a Robotics Engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions for real-world challenges. I'm driven by a relentless curiosity to bridge the gap between theory and practice in robotics, and to create innovative solutions for the future.
My skills and expertise include <b>Computer Vision</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b>, and <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>, which I apply to real-life challenges in robotics.

I have substantial experience with ROS as well as ROS2, designing and building robot hardware, and developing its electrical and electronics systems.
I am proficient with Python and its multiple libraries like PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, PyBullet, OpenCV, NumPy, etc, and I have experience working with C++ and MATLAB.

I'm currently pursuing my <b>MS in <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/robotics-engineering">Robotics Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)</a></b>. I'm a Graduate Student Researcher at the <b><a href="https://wp.wpi.edu/merlab/">Manipulation and Environmental Robotics Lab</a></b>, where I'm developing novel approaches to rearrange the waste pile in recycling plants for efficient robotic waste sorting. This project involves using depth images and point clouds to manipulate the waste stream using a robotic arm, and uncover occluded and covered objects.

Previously, I contributed to cutting-edge research in medical robots at <b><a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <a href="https://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php">Biorobotics Lab</a></b>, where I developed image segmentation and needle insertion algorithms for trauma care.
I also explored learning-based legged locomotion strategies at <b><a href="https://www.stochlab.com/">Stoch Lab, Robert Bosch Center for Cyber-Physical Systems</a> at <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a></b>, where I deployed reinforcement learning based control policies on a quadrupedal robot.
